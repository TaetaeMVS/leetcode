#
# Given an integer array nums, return an array answer such that answer[i] is
# equal to the product of all the elements of nums except nums[i].
# 
# The product of any prefix or suffix of nums is guaranteed to fit in a 32-bit
# integer.
# 
# You must write an algorithm that runs in O(n) time and without using the
# division operation.
# 
# 
# Example 1:
# Input: nums = [1,2,3,4]
# Output: [24,12,8,6]
# Example 2:
# Input: nums = [-1,1,0,-3,3]
# Output: [0,0,9,0,0]
# 
# 
# Constraints:
# 
# 
# 2 <= nums.length <= 10^6
# -30 <= nums[i] <= 30
# The product of any prefix or suffix of nums is guaranteed to fit in a 32-bit
# integer.
# 
# 
# 
# Follow up: Can you solve the problem in O(1) extra space complexity? (The
# output array does not count as extra space for space complexity analysis.)

class Solution:
    def productExceptSelf(self, nums: List[int]) -> List[int]:
        length = len(nums)
        answer = [1] * len(nums)
        
        # fill answer array with left products
        left_product = 1
        for i in range(length):
            answer[i] *= left_product
            left_product *= nums[i]
        
        # multiply by right product
        right_product = 1
        for i in range(length - 1, -1, -1):
            answer[i] *= right_product
            right_product *= nums[i]
        
        return answer
